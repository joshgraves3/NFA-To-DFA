Worked with Jordan Ott. 

We had the project done using this type of file:

1	2	3
a	b
1
1
1,b=2
1,EPS=3
2,a=2
2,a=3
2,b=3
3,a=1

Basically the same as what was provided minus brackets and spaces for the transitions. We figured this would be okay since it is so similar so that we didn't have to redo a portion of our project.
